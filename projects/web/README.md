# FoodSolutios---Web-Project
RMIT group project

# Ideas
This is a food order service website that create to solve the hunger of university students. Nonetheless, we also wanted to create a pplatform for home cooker to sell their food to university students. We hope to provide cheaper, food for student and income for home cooker. 
The project do not have implemented database due to the scope of the course and the limited course resources.
